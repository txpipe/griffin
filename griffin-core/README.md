# Griffin Core

Fundamental building blocks for the Griffin ledger, runtime, and wallet.

It was initially based on [tuxedo_core](https://off-narrative-labs.github.io/Tuxedo/tuxedo_core/index.html), and it now includes a clone of six crates from the [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) suite, with modifications in order to be used in a `no-std` setting.

The Core main purpose is to bring the Griffin node to life. The node is based on Substrate / Polkadot SDK, and the instructions to make it run can be found [here](https://github.com/txpipe/griffin/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#griffin).
