## Installation

You should have a properly installed Griffin node to build the wallet. After following the [instructions to do that](https://github.com/txpipe/griffin/blob/main/README.md#installation), run

```bash
cargo +1.86 build --release -p griffin-wallet
```

As explained in the node installation instructions, omitting the `--release` will build the "debug" version.
