The following command starts a block-producing development node that doesn't persist state:

```bash
./target/release/griffin-solochain-node --dev
```

To purge the development chain's state, run the following:

```bash
./target/release/griffin-solochain-node purge-chain --dev
```

Development chains are set to 

- maintain state in a temporary folder while the node is running;
- use the Alice account as default validator authority; and
- are preconfigured with a genesis state (/node/src/chain_spec.rs).


To preserve the chain state between runs, specify a base path as follows:

```bash
// Create a folder to use as the db base path
$ mkdir my-chain-state

// Use of that folder to store the chain state
$ ./target/release/solochain-template-node --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/

// Check the folder structure created inside the base path after running the chain
$ ls ./my-chain-state
chains
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/
dev
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/dev
db keystore network
```
