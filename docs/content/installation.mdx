Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional packages required to compile the node and the wallet. Check the [install](https://docs.substrate.io/install/) instructions for your platform for the most common dependencies.

In particular, you might need to add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and the `rust-src` component.

### Building

Use the following command to build the node:

```bash
cargo build --package griffin-solochain-node --release
```

*Note on exhaustion*. The building process is **memory-intensive**, and you might need to close some programs (browser, etc.) if you are getting errors during the last part (e.g. from `collect2` or `ld` at the linking step).

### Debug Build

For a faster building process (but resulting in unoptimized binaries), you can build both the node and the wallet in debug mode by running the previous commands without the `--release` flag. In this case, the resulting binaries will be located in the `./target/debug` directory.
